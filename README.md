### Comments
  - Used styled components for styling
  - Opted for using a combination of the useReducer hook and the context api to handle the app state for simplicity, for a bigger application where other features such as middlewares are required, probably redux, mobx or mst is the way to go
  - Although probably unnecessary for such a small application I decided to use formik to handle forms and yup for schemas validation.
